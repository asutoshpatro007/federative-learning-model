# federative-learning-model
implimentation of federative learning
The federative learning model-
The main functionality that is being represented in the model is the working function of federative learning, there by creating a server and also clients.
As the federative learning model suggests the user privacy by training the model locally on the user part updating the global model, here we connect the server and client and the model calculating the accuracy-


STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE
The above part explains the procedural working of the code.for the the practical implementation-
1.unzip the code file from the zip.
2.open command prompt.
3.redirect the path to the existing folder.
4.run the server by the command line-python server1.py
5.after the server shows amessage to connect the client ,open another command prompt and redirect to the existing folder.
6. now run the client with the command line -python client1.py
7.now repeat the same procedure to connect another client ,with yet another command prompt and with same command line-python client1.py
8.after connecting both the clients to the server the command prompt shows the calculated losses
